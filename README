# GameEngineUI
This is a more modern version of the game engine I previously made for a school project. 

This version was also made for a school project to add UI to the game engine.

The UI in this engine was based on Scribblenauts.

# Controls 
Use the mouse to click on buttons on the screen.

Use the arrow keys to navigate menus.
